## Description ##
I present to you an interesting game that you will love. It was created using the Unity program.
 While making, the entire process was followed for the 2D game to work. 
 From the graphic drawing of objects that are on the scene and the creation of the character, animation, sound, controllers and more have been customized. 
 In order to make the game functional, I achieved it by using C # encoding.
